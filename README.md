# Transport-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization

This project focuses on retrieving bus data from the Journeys API, tracking delay time, and calculating average speeds for each bus. The analysis and visualization components provide valuable insights into efficiency and reliability of the transporatation network.

The bsdata.py python script records real-time loacation data within the transporation network, using the journeys API provided by ITS Factory.

The busdatastats.py script processes the stored JSON data to calculate the number of different vehicles and unique data points recorded for each bus line. 

The busspeeds.py script analyzes the recorded bus data from the json file illustrating the speed of a single bus over a period.
